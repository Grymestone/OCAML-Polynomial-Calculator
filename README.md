# OCAML-Polynomial-Calculator

Group: Nicholas Suhlman and Daniel Volya

- run `make tests` and observe the results
- Fully functional Polynomial Calculator that works with terms like (1x + 2x^2)^10 and so on
- must input 1x rather than just x due to parser
- Using Sort.list function, which will soon be deprecated and now gives warnings
